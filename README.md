Advanced Statistical Approaches to Quality
==========================================

This repository contains an exploration of advanced statistical methods applied to the Dry Bean dataset, specifically focusing on classification and dimensionality reduction techniques. The project demonstrates the use of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, **Random Forest Classifier**, and other machine learning techniques to analyze and classify dry bean grains based on various features.

Project Overview
----------------

This project was developed as part of my individual coursework. The dataset consists of images of 13,611 grains from 7 different types of registered dry beans, with 16 features extracted from each grain. The goal is to classify the dry beans into their respective categories based on these features using statistical and machine learning approaches.

### Key Features of the Dataset:

1.  **Area (A)**: Area of a bean zone, representing the number of pixels within its boundaries.
2.  **Perimeter (P)**: Length of the bean's border (circumference).
3.  **Major Axis Length (L)**: The longest distance between two points on the bean.
4.  **Minor Axis Length (l)**: The longest distance perpendicular to the major axis.
5.  **Aspect Ratio (K)**: The ratio between the major and minor axes.
6.  **Eccentricity (Ec)**: Eccentricity of an ellipse with the same moments as the bean.
7.  **Convex Area (C)**: Area of the smallest convex polygon surrounding the bean.
8.  **Equivalent Diameter (Ed)**: Diameter of a circle with the same area as the bean.
9.  **Extent (Ex)**: Ratio of pixels in the bounding box to the total area of the bean.
10. **Solidity (S)**: The ratio of pixels in the convex hull to the bean's pixels.
11. **Roundness (R)**: Calculated as 4πAP2\frac{4 \pi A}{P^2}P24πA​, representing the roundness of the bean.
12. **Compactness (CO)**: Ratio of equivalent diameter to the major axis length.
13. **Shape Factors (SF1, SF2, SF3, SF4)**: Various shape factors calculated from the bean's geometry.
14. **Class**: The bean variety, one of the following: Seker, Barbunya, Bombay, Cali, Dermosan, Horoz, or Sira.

Key Techniques and Analysis
---------------------------

### 1\. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The dataset undergoes exploratory analysis to understand the distribution and relationships of the various features. This includes:

-   Visualizations such as box plots to explore feature distributions.
-   Correlation analysis to identify any dependencies between features.

### 2\. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is performed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, making it easier to visualize and improving the performance of classification models by eliminating redundant features.

### 3\. Classification

A **Several classifcation algorithms** are used to predict the class of each dry bean based on the extracted features. Each model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

-   **Accuracy Score**
-   **Classification Report** (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

### 4\. Visualizations

-   **Scree Plot**: To visualize the importance of each principal component in PCA.
-   **Box Plots**: To identify outliers and distribution patterns of different features.
